Notes

1) Describe Class vs Instance.

Class = Blueprint from which objects are created.
Instance = Same as an object.
Object = Similiar to real world object.

2) What is an Angular component?

Component = Basic building block of a UI (user interface)
Think of a "component" as a container for blocks of code.

3) What is the difference between a Property and a Method?
                                                                    Property is a value
Method:                                                             Method is a function
- Function stored in an object.                                     Example:
- Contains action statements.                                       Car{color,Model,Brand}
- Returns results (values) of work being done.                      Car is the Object. 
- Represents action, encapsulates an operation.                     Color,Model,Brand is the Property

Property:
- Represents data.
- Retrieves data from an object.

4) Describe a class as it is used in Hero.ts.

I did not get to this question.
